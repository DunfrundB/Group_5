#Discussion
#Data analysis is a powerful tool when analyzing the stock market. However, algorithms are unable to take in account human emotions, e.g., "F.O.M.O", the fear of missing out. The fear of missing out causes investors to go from logical buyers to emotional buyers, which can be detrimental in the world of investing. However, there are instances where emotional buyers can drive the stock price upwards, e.g., the meme stock rally with #GME and #AMC. People who are "emotional buyers" tend to be easily influenced to follow the crowd, however, this data shows that the "F.O.M.O" factor of Jim Cramer recommendations are insignificant, at least in this time frame. The data shows stock performance is driven by business fundamentals and the macroenviornment of the stock market in general. It should also be noted that the statistics may be skewed due to the bearish market at the time these recommendations were made.
