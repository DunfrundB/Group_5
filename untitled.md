# ANALYSIS of Cramer's 2020 Pandemic Stock Picks

#### How have Cramer's recommendations performed over 1 month since making recommendation?


#### Are his recommendations in specific sectors better than others?


#### What is the performance of his most recommended stocks?


#### How do his recommendations compare to the S&P 500?
    When looking at Cramer's picks in comparison to the S&P 500 over a 1 month period (March 6, 2020 until April 6, 2020), the results were rather interesting.  When comparing his recommendations to the S&P 500, beta analysis is a great place to start.  Beta is a meausre of the volatitlity or systemic risk of a security or portofolio as compared to the market (S&P 500 in this case) as a whole.  The beta's of the 20 stocks he selected ranged from -0.28 to as much as 1.23 with the average beta being 0.72.  This means on average, the 20 stocks Cramer selected, have a very similar pattern of volatility to the market and move relatively close to the market movements.  I also ran a correlation between all of the stocks and the and plotted it as a heat map.
