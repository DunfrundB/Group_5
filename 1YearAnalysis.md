The one year cumulative returns for Cramer's Pandemic Portfolio was 6.15% starting on 03/06/2020. ETSY yielded the biggest cumulative return at 242%. WHile AAPL preformed the worst at -54%. A major factor skewing the results is the fact that the data pull started during a huge dip in the market initiated by the pandemic. 
In comparing Cramer's portfolio to the S&P 500 AAPL, MKC, and CPB show the biggest negative correlation to not only the snp but also every other stock. The beta analysis shows that Cramer's Portfolio was not very volitile compared to the movement of the rest of the market as a whole. The highest volitility being COST at only .563 and the least volitle pick ZM at -.046. 
I also made two Monte Carlo Simulations for a 1 year price prediction of an initial investment of $5000 into Cramer's Portfolio and into the S&P 500. Cramer's picks can be expected to preform very consitantly with the SPY index. With a 95% chance the initial investment into his picks would yield returns in the range of $6336.68 and $10193.35. While the SPY index return is projected to fall between $3382.01 and $11926.21. In conclusion Cramer's picks are a safe portfolio that stacks up competitively with the S&P 500.
